                <h2>SUPERMAN Ultimate Flight</h2>
                <p>Superman: Ultimate Flight is a steel flying roller coaster designed by Bolliger & Mabillard.[2][3][4] Themed to the popular comic book character, Superman: Ultimate Flight has been installed at three Six Flags theme parks around the United States: Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Great Adventure and Six Flags Great America. Superman: Ultimate Flight simulates flying by positioning its passengers parallel to the track, supported by harnesses and facing the ground through most of the ride. In the station, riders board the train sitting down. After the train is locked and checked, the trains are raised into the flying position. After the ride, the seats are lowered back into the sitting position for the next round of riders.</p>

                <h2>Kingda Ka</h2>
                <p>Plans to build Kingda Ka were announced on September 10, 2004, at an event held for roller coaster enthusiasts and the media.[4] The event revealed the park's goal to build "the tallest and fastest roller coaster on earth", reaching 456 feet (139 m) and accelerating up to 128 miles per hour (206 km/h) in 3.5 seconds.[5] On January 13, 2005, Kingda Ka's tower construction was completed,[6] and on May 21, 2005, the ride opened to the public. Kingda Ka became the "tallest" and "fastest" roller coaster in the world, taking both world records from Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point. It lost the title of world's fastest when Formula Rossa at Ferrari World opened in November 2010.[7] Intamin designed both Kingda Ka and Top Thrill Dragster, and the two share a similar design and layout that differs primarily by the theme and the additional hill featured on Kingda Ka.[8] Both rides were built by Stakotra[9] and installed by Martin & Vleminckx.</p>

                <h2>Valravn</h2>
                <p>Valravn is a steel roller coaster at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. Built and designed by Bolliger & Mabillard (B&M), it opened on May 7, 2016, as the tallest, fastest, and longest dive coaster in the world. Valravn is also the third Dive Coaster model, characterized by its use of wide trains, to open in the United States and the first to use over-the-shoulder "vest" style restraints. The installation also marks the 100th roller coaster designed by B&M since their founding in 1988. Following on the heels of Rougarou, which opened at Cedar Point in 2015, Valravn also takes its name from cultural folklore. The ride's theme is based on a mythological bird from Danish folklore called the valravn, which means "raven of the slain".</p>
